useLoaderData() --> here it is useful because it depends on render as you fetch property while 
useEffect() depends on the fetch after render property which create waterfalls

useNavigation() --> It is universal so it will appear everytime

useNavigate() -> It helps to navigate to particular page, we can use this when we want to contionally show something

useRouteError()
