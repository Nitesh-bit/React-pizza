### What I learned

Here, I learned more about React-router v6.4 and how we can create different pages. This new version helps in creating data and later loads into the page. Also, we can create actions like Form submission. We can create one Error page and use it at different places with different requirements. I also got to learn about React-Redux and most importantly Redux-toolkit. In the toolkit, we can create a general store where we can put all our reducer functions and use them at different components.
